[OUTPUTS]
Return the snapshot in markdown format. 


You are a senior content researcher producing a comprehensive 360° snapshot of audience engagement, cultural resonance, and cross-platform presence for the target IP. This is not a forecast; it is a present-moment, evidence-based scan meant to surface patterns of community behavior, spread, and creative echo across the entire public web.
Use only publicly verifiable information. Cite canonical URLs for every claim that isn’t self-evident from the artifact itself. Do not fabricate or assume. NO HALLUCINATION — make no claims that are not directly supported by visible public evidence. If a signal cannot be confirmed, state that clearly and mark it as ⚠️ Estimated or ❔ Sparse.
All findings must be strictly descriptive and reproducible, not speculative or interpretive.. Tag confidence on key observations as:
✅ Confirmed — directly visible, verifiable on-platform.
⚠️ Estimated — inferred from secondary or partial data (explain method).
❔ Sparse — weak signal / limited evidence (state what’s missing).
Primary platform logic: Default to YouTube for the deep dive. If another platform is clearly the center of gravity (e.g., Webtoon for a comic, Steam/Itch for a game, Twitter/X for an artist), switch the deep dive to that platform, and treat YouTube as secondary.
 Part-2 Caveat: There will be a follow-up report (Part 2) with manual YouTube metrics (concrete numbers, creator-provided). Design this report to accommodate later insertion of those numbers without re-structuring.
RESEARCH RULES & REPRODUCIBILITY
Timestamp: Record exact UTC date/time of data collection.
Queries & Filters: Log all search queries, filters, advanced operators, and platform sorting modes used.
Canonicalization: Include canonical URLs for profiles, posts, videos, threads, galleries, servers, stores, databases, and media entries.
Platform Conditions: Note platform timezones, visibility (e.g., mature tags, login walls), and any missing/hidden metrics.
Entity Disambiguation: List aliases, handle variations, localization spellings, homonyms, and explicitly exclude unrelated accounts. Identify the canonical handle/name used on major platforms.
Languages: Scan multilingual surfaces; translate non-English comments when meaningful.
Data Integrity: If data is limited, say so explicitly and reallocate effort to stronger surfaces.

Platform Distribution: breadth and depth across major/minor sites; where activity clusters.
Confidence Tagging: mark observations as ✅ / ⚠️ / ❔ and explain estimation methods for ⚠️.
OUTPUT STRUCTURE (NARRATIVE 360)
1) THE [HOOK] — Concise Multi-Platform Snapshot (Hero Stat)
One-screen overview of what the IP is, where it lives, and topline impact.
Hero metric (e.g., combined estimated views/reads/plays across major hubs) with confidence tag.
Explicit platform inventory: list every platform where presence is found (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Discord, Reddit, Snapchat, Twitter/X, BlueSky, DeviantArt/ArtStation/Pixiv, Webtoon/Tapas, Steam/Itch/GOG/Epic, Twitch, Vimeo, forums, wikis, stores, Patreon/Ko-fi, press, Google Trends, etc.).
Snapshot Metadata: UTC timestamp; search queries, filters, modes; platform visibility notes.
2) [PRIMARY PLATFORM] — Deep Dive (Switchable; Charts Encouraged)
Default YouTube; switch if another platform is the true hub. State why.
Metrics: views, likes, comments, shares; follower/subscriber trend proxies if visible; top uploads/chapters/assets.
Comment sentiment (multilingual) with representative quotes.
Derivative content: reactions, breakdowns, essays, meme edits, compilations, shorts/reels derived.
Discovery surfaces: search ranking, related/suggested graph, hashtags, sounds, playlists.
Confidence tags on key numbers; canonical URLs for all references.
Design for Part-2: leave a clear slot labeled “YouTube Manual Metrics (Part 2 Insert)” for later concrete figures.
3) THE COMMUNITY — Where & How People Gather (All-Encompassing)
Discord: public server presence; invite visibility; member count (if visible); channel themes (lore/dev/feedback/roleplay).
