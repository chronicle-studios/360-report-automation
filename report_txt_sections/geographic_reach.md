The Reach — Geographic and Demographic Spread

Geographically, interest in M.O.M. was initially concentrated in English-speaking regions (North America,
UK) thanks to Image Comics’ release and Clarke’s fanbase, but it did extend to other parts of the world in a
notable way:
North America: The US was the largest market (the comic was heavily covered by US media, and
sales in the direct market were primarily US comic shops). Canada also saw engagement, though on
a smaller scale; Canadian comic stores reported moderate pull list demand (Clarke’s Canadian fans
picking it up out of curiosity). Demographically in NA, a mix of regular comic readers (traditionally
male 18-45 demographic) and new female readers (Clarke’s fans, often teens and young women)
showed up at shops or online to get the book. Some comic retailers even noted “we saw a few new
female customers asking for Mother of Madness” ⚠ on forums, an uncommon occurrence driven by
the celebrity factor.
Europe: The UK had strong interest, given Emilia Clarke is British. Forbidden Planet in London
hosted an official launch signing event where Clarke appeared (masked, during 2021’s pandemic
conditions) – this drew a sizable crowd (reports say ~200 people lined up, overwhelmingly female
attendees) ⚠. The British press (BBC Radio, Guardian, Empire) also gave it coverage. Continental
Europe: as mentioned, Spain got a localized edition in 2023, indicating enough interest to justify
translation. Spanish-speaking fan response included reviews in Spain and some in Latin America
(a Mexican geek blog reviewed it positively as “feminist and fun,” noting how rare such themes are in
comics there). There’s no confirmation of a French or German edition – likely not, as no record was
found, so reach in those markets was probably limited to English-reading expats or online fans. Italy
may have had interest due to Leila Leiz (the artist) being of Italian background; indeed Italian comics
news sites translated some interviews, but no Italian print edition is noted. Russia and Eastern Europe:
minimal data, but a few Russian pop-culture sites translated the news of Clarke’s comic in 2021
(given GoT’s huge following in Russia). This suggests some awareness but likely low distribution (no
official Russian translation known).
Asia and other regions: Latin America – beyond Spain’s edition, there isn’t evidence of a separate
Latin American Spanish print, but digital versions were accessible. Some discussions on Reddit came
from Latin American users who got the English version digitally and commented in Spanish that they
enjoyed the “loco comic de Emilia Clarke”⚠. Brazil: We didn’t find a Portuguese edition, so reach
there was probably confined to die-hard Clarke fans importing it. Asia: In South Asia, Clarke’s fame
from GoT is big, but comics readership is niche. Still, Indian entertainment sites (like Firstpost)
reported on M.O.M. , indicating at least media interest. No sign of a Japanese or Korean release –
the content might be seen as too culturally specific to Western feminism to find a big audience in
East Asia. However, interestingly, some Japanese Twitter users mentioned it when it was announced,
mostly surprised/amused (one tweet in Japanese said “Daenerys wrote a manga? LOL”). Middle East:
Clarke’s popularity ensured some buzz – e.g., an Arabic film/comics blog did a piece on it (translating
the premise). But again, actual readership there would require English proficiency or an unlikely
localized version.
Demographics: The engagement for M.O.M. skewed more female than typical for a comic book. Instagram
analytics (from social listening, not official) indicated a majority of commenters on Clarke’s posts were
women in their teens and 20s⚠. Goodreads reviewers also had a notable proportion of women. This is
unusual for a direct-market comic and highlights how the IP bridged into a different demo via Clarke’s
appeal. The traditional comics male audience (ages 20-40) was certainly present too – often the loudest
voices on Reddit/forums. Age-wise, many of Clarke’s core fans are millennials or Gen Z (she’s 36 now, many
fans in their 20s); indeed a lot of the enthusiastic social media posts came from younger women who don’t
usually read comics. Conversely, some older comic collectors interacted mainly in the speculation market
(with an eye on potential future value rather than content). Global time zones: Social media spikes
happened around Clarke’s posts (which were often timed in UK daytime or US morning). A Google Trends
peek for “Mother of Madness” in July 2021 showed the highest interest in the UK, USA, Canada, and
surprisingly the Philippines (possibly due to strong GoT fandom there) ⚠.
Cross-platform Amplification: There were feedback loops between platforms: Clarke’s Instagram post
drove many to search on Google or go to comic shops (multiple anecdotal reports of people saying “I saw
this on Emilia’s IG, had to check it out”). The press articles often embedded her Instagram or Twitter posts
(for instance, Variety’s piece included the Instagram announcement image). Reddit discussions were
occasionally linked in YouTube video descriptions (some YouTubers referenced Reddit opinions to bolster
their reviews). Meanwhile, Clarke’s Fallon appearance prompted a wave of tweets and IG stories – fans
clipped the moment she holds up the comic on TV and circulated it. Discord↔Reddit↔YouTube cross-
traffic: A minor example: a comic YouTuber in his review mentioned “people on Reddit are saying it’s a cringe
fest”, showing how Reddit sentiment leaked into YouTube content . Also, the Forbidden Planet signing
news went from their Facebook → was shared on the ComicsHeatingUp forum → then on Reddit.
Overall, the IP’s reach was amplified primarily by Emilia Clarke’s own media gravity – whenever she talked
about it (Instagram, TV, interviews), a broad set of channels echoed that content. After the initial
promotional push ended, cross-platform chatter died down, meaning the ongoing reach relies on organic
discovery (e.g. a new reader picks it up on comiXology now and maybe tweets about it).
In summary, M.O.M. had a wide but shallow reach: it touched many regions at launch thanks to global
media coverage (confirmed by multilingual press ) and engaged an atypically diverse audience for a
comic (women, non-comics readers). However, that reach was not deeply rooted – it was more a burst than
a sustained spread. Still, the fact that by 2023 people in Spain were reviewing it , and by 2025 you can
find references in multiple languages, shows it achieved a measure of global penetration that few three-
issue comics do. The reach can be characterized as broad initial visibility with limited enduring
penetration, which aligns with its nature as a celebrity-driven project.
