The Community — Where & How People Gathered

Despite the short run, M.O.M. attracted discussion in diverse communities. However, there is no
evidence of an enduring dedicated fan community (e.g. no official Discord or active fan forum solely for
M.O.M.) . Instead, conversation peaked around release in general comic fan spaces and then dispersed.
Reddit: The comic was debated in major subreddits like r/comicbooks. An “[Excerpt] M.O.M. – new
comic by Emilia Clarke” thread in July 2021 garnered numerous comments (score in the hundreds) .
Readers reacted to preview pages and concept: “The art is great... The story was a bit hard to follow”
said one user, while others were intrigued by the premise or skeptical of the execution (some likened
the quirky powers to something from “a DeviantArt fan comic,” according to one early commenter)
⚠ . Sentiment on Reddit skewed mixed-to-negative initially – a few praised the humor and
feminist angle, but many expressed cynicism toward a celebrity comic. Upvote patterns: Comments
critiquing the writing got substantial upvotes, indicating a portion of the Reddit comics crowd didn’t
fully embrace the book. No dedicated subreddit exists for M.O.M., but the title pops up occasionally
in broader threads (e.g. “What are some mind-bending comics?” where one user recommended it as
a short, wild read). Overall Reddit activity was sporadic and moderate, centering on the
announcement and issue #1 release.
Comic Book Forums & Discord: On the ComicsHeatingUp forum (a comic speculation community),
a thread on M.O.M. appeared as early as April 2021 . Speculators discussed whether Clarke’s
involvement could mean a movie option and boost collector value. Reactions were split: some read
the 4-page preview and declared “the book is a mess…I’m going to pass”, and “Art looks terrible. Pass.”
. Others said they’d preorder a copy “just in case” it took off ⚠. Notably, a user who got an
advance read of issue #1 later came back to say “I was quite pleased with it. Didn’t think I’d like it as
much as I did.” , showing that initial skepticism wasn’t universal. That forum also coordinated
around a Forbidden Planet signed edition link, with several members purchasing Clarke-
autographed copies (despite steep shipping) . This indicates a small subset of collectors and
fans rallied to get limited merch. No public Discord server for M.O.M. could be located . If any
Discord discussion occurred, it was likely within broader comics servers rather than a dedicated
channel for this series. Facebook Groups: In general comics Facebook groups, M.O.M. posts got
modest engagement. E.g., a post in a women-in-comics group celebrating the all-women creative
team saw a few dozen likes and supportive comments (users tagging friends with “we should read
this!”) ⚠. There wasn’t an organized Facebook fan group for M.O.M., reflecting the title’s limited
longevity.
Goodreads & Book Communities: Goodreads functioned as a hub for reader-driven discussion. By
end of 2021, a few hundred Goodreads users had logged the book. Commenters exchanged views in
review threads – some new comics readers (pulled in by Clarke’s name) discussed the graphic novel
format and content in lay terms, while comics veterans compared it to other feminist comics. The
Goodreads “Ask a Question” feature even saw a few questions to authors, but with no official
answers. Goodreads didn’t host real-time interaction, but its review section essentially became a
micro-forum for the title’s audience.
International & Niche Communities: Outside English-language spheres, Spanish comic forums
and blogs picked up M.O.M. when it was translated. The Spanish publisher Planeta released Mother
of Madness in 2023 , prompting discussion on sites like Zona Negativa and Las Cosas Que Nos
Hacen Felices. These communities approached it as a feminist comic book import – forum members
in Spain debated the social commentary (some embraced the “cómic de superhéroes feminista”
message , others found it on-the-nose). Engagement was modest (Zona Negativa’s review got a
few comments, and a Telegram channel post logged ~292 views ), but it shows the work
resonated enough to be spotlighted abroad. No notable activity was found on platforms like
Mastodon or Bluesky specifically about M.O.M., aside from automated news bot posts.
Community Texture: The audience gathering around M.O.M. was an unusual mix – traditional comic fans
(some wary of celebrity hype) and Clarke’s pop-culture fanbase (many of whom are younger, more female,
and not regular comics readers). This led to interesting cross-talk: e.g., on Instagram, you had GoT fans
excitedly commenting with dragon emojis alongside comics folks tagging their local shop. On Reddit and
forums, long-time readers discussed it in context of industry trends (comparing it to Keanu Reeves’ BRZRKR,
another star comic). The language of discussion varied: phrases like “LOL this is wild” or “Yass queen
energy” appeared in IG comments (from Clarke’s fans), whereas forums had more cynical humor (“How long
till the movie option?” ). There was some meme-ification: a few meme images on Twitter joking about
“super period powers” circulated, though these were short-lived. We also see overlap with feminist and geek
communities – e.g., women-in-comics circles lauded the effort and shared links during Women’s History
Month lists. In summary, people gathered in loosely connected pockets, and while no single persistent
“home base” formed for M.O.M. fans, the conversation bridged normally separate groups (celebrity
followers and comic insiders) for a moment.
