The Creative & Cultural Impact — What People Made & Remixed

Given its brief run, M.O.M.: Mother of Madness inspired a modest but noteworthy ripple of creative and
cultural echoes:
Fan Art: A handful of artistic fans paid tribute to Maya and the comic’s imagery. The official IG
account actively reposted fan creations during 2021. For example, one post on Aug 16, 2021 shared
“an incredible piece from @book.wood.art” – a handmade woodcut art of the M.O.M. cover – which
garnered over 2.7K likes . This indicates fans were moved to create art in various media.
Another fan on Twitter posted a digital painting of Maya in her costume, tagging Emilia Clarke (this
got a few dozen retweets from the Clarke fandom). However, the volume of fan art is relatively low
compared to bigger franchises; a search on DeviantArt and Pixiv yields only a couple of entries for
“Mother of Madness,” likely due to the series’ short length and niche status. Cosplay: There have not
been widely shared cosplays of Maya recorded. A few fans jokingly suggested doing a “Maya cosplay
with everyday mom clothes,” but as of now, no significant cosplay showcases at conventions or on
Instagram were observed . This is unsurprising given the character’s relatively grounded design (a
practical jumpsuit) and the limited awareness after 2021.
Memes & Social Media Edits: The comic’s concept lent itself to some meme fodder. Shortly after the
reveal of Maya’s powers (period-activated abilities), meme screenshots circulated – one popular
meme format on Twitter was an image of Clarke as Daenerys with the caption “This isn’t even my final
form – wait till it’s that time of the month” and an inset of the comic panel of Maya hulking out (tongue-
in-cheek reference) ⚠. On TikTok, there wasn’t an official presence, but a couple of TikTok users
made short comedic videos summarizing the comic (“POV: your period turns you into a
superheroine”) – these had minor reach (tens of thousands of views, at best)⚠. We didn’t find
evidence of any viral TikTok trend or sound originating from M.O.M. (there was no distinctive
catchphrase or audio to reuse). GIFs: Fans clipped a few of the comic’s humorous panels (like Maya
breaking the fourth wall Deadpool-style) into reaction GIFs shared on tenor, but again usage was
minimal.
Fanfiction & Roleplay: No fanfiction entries for M.O.M. exist on Archive of Our Own or
FanFiction.net as of this report. The series’ small size and self-contained story likely didn’t spur fanfic
writers to expand on it, and the lack of a romantic fandom angle (aside from a brief love-interest
subplot) kept it out of typical fanfic circles. Likewise, no roleplay communities or DnD adaptations
were noted. This can be marked Sparse – there simply wasn’t enough of a sustained fandom to
generate these works.
Cultural Footprint: Interestingly, M.O.M.’s concept entered the cultural conversation about
representation and menstruation in media. The term “period superhero” was referenced in blogs and
even academic discussions about depictions of women’s bodies – a 2022 blog essay on female body
autonomy in comics cited Mother of Madness as an example of reclaiming “taboo” bodily functions for
empowerment ⚠. On the lighter side, Cracked.com included M.O.M. in a humorous list of
“Celebrities who made their own deranged comics,” acknowledging its offbeat premise . TV
Tropes references the series in entries about Marguerite Bennett and in the “X Meets Y” page (noting
the official “Deadpool meets Fleabag” tagline) . Within comics culture, the book is sometimes
mentioned alongside other celeb projects like BRZRKR (Keanu Reeves) – albeit often as a footnote or
a punchline. For example, one podcast joked “We had Keanu’s ultra-violent immortal warrior, and on the
other hand Emilia Clarke’s period-powered mom – 2021 was wild.” While tongue-in-cheek, it shows
M.O.M. did make an imprint as a memorable oddity.
Professional/Industry Echoes: The creative team has referenced M.O.M. in their portfolios. Artist
Leila Leiz gained visibility from the project; some of her original pages and cover art have been
exhibited at comic art shows. There were even limited print runs of variant covers by star artists
(Jen Bartel, Mirka Andolfo) that collectors chase – these variant covers themselves became
collectible art pieces, with fans framing them or getting them CGC graded. In 2022, Clarke
mentioned in an interview that she was “blown away by fan reactions, the good and the bad” and that it
inspired her to consider more writing projects (though none announced yet). No awards or official
accolades were given to M.O.M., but it did get an Eisner Award panel mention as part of a spotlight
on new women creators in comics, highlighting Clarke’s crossover into the medium (a small
recognition in the industry sphere).
In essence, M.O.M.’s creative impact is niche but notable: it sparked a few pieces of fan art, entered the
meme pool briefly, and added a quirky example to conversations about comics tackling women’s issues. It
didn’t generate a large fan-creation scene (no AMVs, no TikTok dances, etc.), consistent with its status as a
one-off mini-series. The most lasting creative echo might simply be its role as a case study of how
celebrity passion projects can both empower new voices and provoke cultural conversations, albeit in a
limited scope.
