The Opportunities — Future Potential & Gaps

Looking ahead, there are several opportunities and untapped areas for Mother of Madness should the
creators or community choose to build on its foundation, as well as some risks and limitations identified:
Digital and Short-Form Platforms: One clear gap was on platforms like TikTok and YouTube
Shorts. Given the comedic and edgy content of M.O.M., there is potential to repurpose it into short-
form videos or motion comics. For instance, no official motion comic or animated promo was
released – an area that could be explored to give the content a second life and capture younger
audiences on TikTok/Reels. A humorous TikTok series (perhaps with Clarke’s participation) reenacting
scenes or jokes from the comic could have gone viral, but wasn’t attempted. Opportunity: If Clarke
or Image ever wanted to revive interest, partnering with a popular TikTok comic influencer for a
“quick summary” skit or challenge (#MotherOfMadnessChallenge?) could tap into that missed
segment.
International Localization: The response in Spain shows there is international appetite, but many
regions still lack access. A French or Italian translation could find a niche audience, especially since
the comic’s feminist angle might resonate in European markets. Also, translating it into Japanese or
Korean for digital release (e.g., via Webtoon or Line Manga) could be interesting – the over-the-top
concept might attract readers of alternative manga/manhwa. Currently, not doing so is a missed
opportunity. However, cultural differences around the humor and menstrual theme would need
careful localization. Opportunity: Seek partnerships with international comic publishers to localize
the series, turning it into a globally available graphic novel and potentially sparking new discussions
in those languages.
Extension of the Story: As a contained mini-series, M.O.M. ends where it began – there’s room to
expand the world. Fans have speculated about a possible Volume 2 or spin-off focusing on another
character (perhaps Maya’s son growing up, or another woman with different “taboo” powers). If
Clarke were to announce a continuation, it could rejuvenate the fanbase and bring back media
attention. The initial run mostly established the concept; future installments could deepen the
narrative and possibly address the critiques (improving the writing, etc.). Opportunity: Use the
feedback from readers to craft a stronger sequel series – this could turn a one-time buzz into a
recurring franchise. Additionally, an adaptation (animated series or live-action TV) remains an
opportunity. Clarke in interviews half-joked about whom she’d cast as Maya if it went to screen.
Given her clout, she could potentially pitch it to a streamer as an adult animated short series, which
might actually land well (think Harley Quinn animated series style). This hasn’t been tapped yet, but
the door isn’t closed.
Engaging the Community More: One critique was the lack of an ongoing community hub. There
was no official Discord or fan club to keep momentum. Setting up a space (even now, post-release)
for fans to interact with the creators could strengthen goodwill. Clarke has her charity SameYou (for
brain injury) – interestingly, some fans in forums bought the comic partly because they admire her
charity work . Future engagement could tie into that: e.g., limited merch whose proceeds go to
charity, or a special live Q&A with Clarke and the co-writer about the comic. Opportunity: Leverage
Clarke’s star power to host events (virtual book club, Reddit AMA) around M.O.M., converting casual
readers into a more invested community. So far this hasn’t been done.
Platform Gaps: We observed strong Instagram, weak Twitter for M.O.M. There’s still untapped
potential on Twitter/X especially with the comics community there – possibly using the hashtag
#MotherOfMadness for a scheduled read-along or discussion could engage that segment. Similarly,
