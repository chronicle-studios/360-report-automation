The Hook — Multi-Platform Snapshot

M.O.M.: Mother of Madness is a three-issue satirical superhero comic (Image Comics, 2021) co-created by
Emilia Clarke (of Game of Thrones fame) with writer Marguerite Bennett and artist Leila Leiz. Billed as
“Deadpool action meets Fleabag comedy” in its marketing , the series follows Maya, a single mom whose
bizarre powers (tied to her hormonal cycle) fuel a feminist takedown of human traffickers. Upon launch,
M.O.M. #1 became the #5 best-selling comic in July 2021 – the top Image Comics title that month
– signaling strong initial direct-market demand . Clarke’s personal star power drove enormous mainstream
awareness: her Instagram announcement post earned ~847,000 likes and 4,000 comments within a day
. Across Instagram, YouTube, Twitter/X, Reddit, Goodreads, and press outlets worldwide, the title
sparked a broad but short-lived wave of engagement. Major talk shows (Jimmy Fallon) and media sites
(Variety, Newsweek) amplified its reach, while comic fans debated its merits in forums and review sites. As
of 2025, the hype has cooled and no persistent fandom hubs (e.g. ongoing Discord servers or fanfic
communities) are evident , but the series remains a notable case of a celebrity-driven comics venture that
generated multi-platform buzz. (Snapshot collected 2025-11-18 UTC; see Appendix for search queries

Platforms Identified: Instagram (official @mayamotherofmadness account and Emilia Clarke’s
personal IG), YouTube (talk show clips, comic reviews, interviews), Twitter/X (news bites, fan
commentary under #MotherOfMadness), Reddit (comics subreddit discussions), Niche Forums
(comic speculation boards), Goodreads & Amazon (reader ratings/reviews), Press & Blogs (Variety,
Polygon, CBR, ComicsBeat, ComicsXF, etc.), Book sites (Goodreads, Barnes & Noble, etc.), and
international comics blogs (Spanish sites like ZonaNegativa). No significant presence found on
TikTok, Twitch, Webtoon/Tapas, or fanfiction/cosplay archives .
Hero Stat – Cumulative Impact: Estimated ~100,000+ readers and millions reached via social
media and press ⚠. Basis: Issue #1 likely sold tens of thousands of copies (rank #5 in the market)
; Goodreads lists ~400 ratings (avg ~3.1★)⚠ ; Emilia Clarke’s promotional IG post reached
nearly a million users ; a Fallon Tonight Show clip featuring M.O.M. garnered ~682K YouTube
views . These signals suggest an initial surge of awareness that cut across comics fandom and
Clarke’s mainstream audience. (Confidence: strong for relative scale, ⚠ estimate for exact totals.)
Cross-Platform Engagement & Content Highlights
Video Platforms (YouTube & Talk Shows): YouTube features a modest array of content around M.O.M.,
mixing official promos and fan commentary. On the high end, Emilia Clarke’s July 2021 appearance on The
Tonight Show (promoting M.O.M. and her Marvel role) drew hundreds of thousands of views – one official
Fallon clip has ~682K views . Clarke also recorded a short intro for retailer Forbidden Planet’s special
edition (YouTube video “Emilia Clarke Introduces M.O.M.”) and sat for interview segments on comics
channels. Fan-made reviews saw lower traction: e.g., a “Two Opposing Opinions on M.O.M.” video by a small
comics channel logged ~923 views in 4 years ⚠, and one negative takedown titled “Khaleesi’s Shame – It
ain’t pretty!” barely topped 600 views ⚠. This suggests that while mainstream media coverage was huge,
grassroots YouTube discussion remained niche. (No viral TikToks or major Twitch streams were observed for
this title .)
Social Media (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook): Instagram was a primary hype engine. The official account
@mayamotherofmadness amassed about 15,000 followers during the release period⚠ , and actively
posted sneak peeks and fan spotlights. On release day (July 21, 2021), the official IG celebrated “Happy
M.O.M. release day!!” with ~9.6K likes and 190 comments , indicating strong fan enthusiasm out of the
gate. Emilia Clarke’s personal Instagram (with millions of followers) amplified reach exponentially: her
launch post (“HOLY MOTHER OF MADNESS MY BABY IS BORN TODAY!!!”) garnered 847K likes and nearly
4K comments – an outpouring of excitement from her global fanbase. Other celebrity and media
accounts joined in; e.g. lifestyle newsletter TheSkimm posted about the comic (“Laughs are coming!”) to its
audience , and fan pages on IG shared Clarke’s promo appearances (one fanstyle account racked up
~5.3K likes on a post about her Fallon visit ). On Twitter (X), the hashtag #MotherOfMadness trended
briefly in comics circles around the announcement. News outlets and fan update accounts tweeted
headlines like “Emilia Clarke’s debut comic book features a single mother with period-driven
superpowers” . Engagement on Twitter was moderate – individual tweets from news sites got on the
order of hundreds of likes or less (e.g. a Firstpost tweet summarizing the premise). There wasn’t a long-lived
Twitter community around the comic beyond initial news shares and a few review threads. Facebook saw
scattered discussion in comic fan groups and the official Image Comics page; one comics fan group post
announcing M.O.M. noted the all-female creative team and got modest reactions (dozens of likes/
comments) . Overall, Instagram was the most impactful social channel due to Clarke’s own promotion and
visual content, whereas Twitter and Facebook played secondary roles for news dissemination.
Press & Mainstream Coverage: Traditional and digital media heavily covered M.O.M. at launch. Variety
broke the news of the project in April 2021, highlighting the “single mom whose secret weapon is her
period” hook . This catchy angle was echoed by Newsweek, NME, Polygon, and others , often
with puns about “Mother of Dragons becomes Mother of Madness.” Clarke gave interviews to outlets like
Entertainment Weekly (with a preview) , The Hollywood Reporter and Women Write About
Comics , emphasizing the comic’s feminist themes and her love of the medium. Pop culture sites
(CBR, SYFY Wire, etc.) ran pieces detailing the concept and creative team . Late-night TV provided a
mainstream spotlight: on July 21, 2021, Clarke went on Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show and enthusiastically
plugged M.O.M., an appearance widely shared online (as noted, the YouTube clip alone reached ~0.7M views
). Morning shows and podcasts picked up the story as part of her press tour. The multi-platform media
blitz meant that for a brief period, M.O.M. was everywhere – even non-comics readers heard about “the
comic where Emilia Clarke gives a hero period powers.” This broad exposure was confirmed by high
engagement on social posts and press impressions, though sustaining that broad attention proved
challenging beyond the initial news cycle.
